Let's create a primitive semblance of a public anonymous Twitter, small posts with the ability to rate.

Application features:

         Write posts.
         Give likes.

The server will store information about all messages.

Fields:

         Message text;
         number of likes;
         date of creation.

Our tools:

         Django
         React
         Django CORS
         Django REST framework
         Axios
